what if I told you the developer

experience is the single most important

thing impacting your devs and the

quality of the products they're building

and what if I told you the definition of

developer experience before I went any

further wouldn't that be a smart way to

start this video the best definition of

devex is a Formula that incorporates a

couple key things first it takes into

account how efficiently and productively

a developer can do their very best work

on any given project

so how simple is it for Dev to implement

a change on a code base and how easy is

it to move from having an idea to

putting it into production mdevx

examines how positively or negatively

the work environment workflows and tools

affect that developer's satisfaction and

by eliminating friction and inefficiency

you can multiply your operational impact

if your devs are productive and if they

love what they're doing if collaboration

is smooth and if they keep building

great things and shipping frequently

then the devex at your org is great but

we've all worked at places where none of

those things were happening and we all

did whatever we could to leave because

the developer experience was so bad so

why does this term matter so much to so

many businesses right now the best devs

expect to work with the best tools and

the best environments and those factors

are incredibly important when you try to

hire or retain great developers and at

every company they know that just having

talented people isn't enough those devs

need the right tools and processes to do

their best work devs want a developer

experience that's flexible powerful and

plugs them into AI tools they need to

work quickly and efficiently they want

collaboration and communication to be

simple and they don't want extra steps

like constantly switching between

multiple apps and tools and devex

doesn't just positively impact the

bottom line it also supplies Deads with

the bandwidth and productive space they

need to do things they're passionate

about both inside and outside of work to

learn how to create the ideal developer

experience for your organization right
